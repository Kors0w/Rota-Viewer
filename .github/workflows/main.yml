# Controls when the workflow should run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events to the main branch
  push:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job handles the building and deployment of the application
  build-and-deploy:
    # Runs on the latest version of Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a stable Node version

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Build the production application
      # Ensure your package.json has a 'build' script (e.g., 'react-scripts build' or 'vite build')
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Deploy the built files to the 'gh-pages' branch
