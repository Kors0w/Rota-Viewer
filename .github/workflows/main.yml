# Controls when the workflow should run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events to the main branch
  push:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# **CRITICAL FIX:** Grant necessary permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN to push to the repository
permissions:
  contents: write # Needed for checkout and potentially building
  pages: write    # Needed for deploying to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write # Needed for environments/OIDC, good practice to include

jobs:
  # This job handles the building and deployment of the application
  build-and-deploy:
    # Runs on the latest version of Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Optionally, you can set the environment if you are using Environments feature
    # environment:
    #   name: github-pages
    #   url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a stable Node version
          cache: 'npm'       # Caches node modules for faster builds

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Build the production application
      # Ensure your package.json has a 'build' script
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Deploy the built files to the 'gh-pages' branch
      # This step uses the granted permissions to push the artifacts.
